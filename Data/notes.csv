"After completing my first rough draft of my portfolio, I definitely had my fair share of challenges. Like many of my fellow students, my biggest struggle was compiling presentable work. I honestly do not have much to put on a portfolio in terms of graphic work or writing samples that I felt were good enough to professionally present. Therefore, I chose to focus more on my travel, love of Spanish, and culture. I included a writing sample that I had written during my study abroad in Spain. I included one of the only pieces of graphic design that I had made in my anthropology class freshman year. I?m not sure if I?m going to keep it on my portfolio or not, because I think it looks really kindergarten-y. But I?m going to ask some of my peers what they think, and if they think it?s worth keeping then maybe I will. I need to revise some of my old essays from my English or government classes to make them presentable to post on my portfolio. Another huge hurtle that I had to overcome was the start up of the entire website. I really wanted to use a website that was more picture rather than words. I started off using weebly as my template website, but I found that it just wasn?t what I wanted. Wix really allowed me to do what I wanted with formatting. I enjoyed the freedom that the website gave me, and it personally was very easy to pick up once I got the hang of it. This is one of the first creative, graphic design-like projects that I have done. I?m really excited to make this portfolio look even better and to hear what my peers have to say about it. I think that I?m missing a certain flair to my page, if that makes any sense at all. I think that I need something to make it stand out a little better. I?m going to try to play around this week with coloring, or small, minimalist graphics and see if that helps improve my page."
"I am double majoring in Fashion because it plays such a major role on our society. The multi billion dollar fashion industry is responsible for evoking emotions, representing culture and celebrating being a unique individual. Personal style can say a lot about a person without the initial need for verbal contact My dream job would be to write for a Conde Naste magazine such as Vogue or Elle. I would love to work closely with the beauty department of a major magazine and write how-tos and editorials as well as style for the publication. My passion for writing pulls me in the direction of journalism as a career choice. I like meeting new people and feel that everyone has a story to offer the world. It would be ideal if I could somehow make a small impact on the lives of others during my storytelling as a journalist."
"I feel like I did a great job keeping to the website simple and not overly artisy but pretty professional. There are not too many pages to filp through to get to my resume. Im unsure if I want to post a few points from my resume then post a link for download or if I want to post the entire resume info on the resume page, that might be a lot of words on one page. I had a really hard time writing an openning ""blurb"" on the front page, it sucks. I think I will work on the background next because this weird gray makes it hard for normal font colors like black or white. "
"My first experience making a website was a lot more difficult than I originally anticipated. The most time-consuming part of the portfolio was trying to format everything, so every page looked the same. I tried to change the default settings, but the site kept reverting back to old fonts, spacing etc. It is also difficult for me see if all of the sections on my website have the same spacing when I am editing a page. Every time I click, so many windows pop open that it's difficult for me to touch or adjust anything. It is interesting to note that I was looking for tools on the toolbar from other programs I have used in the past. For example, I was editor of the yearbook in high school and was completely fluent in Adobe InDesign. I found myself searching for various tools on the Weebly toolbar hoping they would accomplish the same tasks on my page, but never found them. I wish there was some sort of interactive tutorial, so I could learn how to intentionally alter things on my page and afterwards possibly even change it back."
"The portfolio was a bit of a struggle for me. But after talking with other students I realized I was not alone. We have not gotten any feedback on the portfolios so I guess I don?t really know what I want to work on yet in that regard. In our last class we talked a lot about pitching. This is not something I am very comfortable with, and I think that comes across in my pitching. I would like to gain more experience with pitching so that I can address people with confidence and ease. I want to look like I know what I?m doing and that people should listen to me and buy whatever I?m trying to sell. Obviously, some of this will come with practice. But I think I will also learn a lot from watching and listening to my peers. This is not an area that I learn much about as a international affairs major, but I think its an important tool. In an interview I might not be trying to sell a product, but I will be trying to sell the interviewer on hiring me. I think working with my PLN will help me gain the confidence I need to properly pitch my ideas. Now I just need to settle on an idea to pitch?"
Throughout the semester I hope to keep improving my portfolio until it showcases all of my work and it becomes something that I am extremely proud of. I hope to learn what is considered acceptable in the professional world especially in terms of pictures and writing. I struggled when it came to picking pictures to put on my about me and as the background. I wanted it to be something that showcases my life but I also don?t want it to come off as just a website that I do in my free time. We talked about the elevator pitch in class which I really struggled with because I don?t find myself particularly creative. I am a statistics minor so I am very good at problem solving which in turn I think puts a block on some of my creativity. I like to think logically and not outside of the box. I hope that throughout my semester I can reach out of my creativity comfort zone and create something great.
"While attempting to create my first website ever, I feel completely lost. I am excited to challenge myself and know that this is a great thing to have, but I really don't know what I am doing. After spending 45 minutes comparing layout themes, I realize that I cannot let the little things consume me just yet. I have put together a basic layout (although still not too enthused with the aesthetics) I am excited about the potential for this website. I want to be able to showcase who I am to my future audience. I highly value my school and campus involvement so I dedicated a page to this. However, I also want my personality to show while maintaing a professional mantra. I am excited to get feedback on how to improve my site and hopefully my tech-saviness as well!"
"I decided to start my prototype portfolio using carbonmade.com because I was attracted to their dynamic templates that used white space very effectively. I am a little bit unsure of my target audience, so I?m finding that it is difficult for me to determine the content that I should include in my portfolio. After using carbonmade for a while I determined that it was geared more towards designers, and so I switched over to wix for a while and I eventually ended up playing around with wordpress as well. I found some work from a non-profit project that I would like to showcase and I think I want to use my portfolio as a way to enhance my resume overall. I can?t seem to find the right tool to present my work how I want. I want this portfolio to show my work to potential employers or graduate schools in a clean and innovative way, but I?m finding it difficult to find the right place to make my vision a reality. I switched over to squarespace because I really like Molly Kalinsky?s site and how it showcases her skills and resume, but I can?t use squarespace well enough to display information in an aesthetic manner. I?m finding that my technical skills are limited and that I would much rather pay for graphic design, than attempt to physically create it myself. After all of that frustration I ended up finding success using squarespace and I think I made some good progress on my portfolio. I think that I can create a website that effectively showcases my experience that creates a strong professional web presence for me."
"I am satisfied with the progress of my portfolio . I like the layout and how relaxed and comfortable my page feels. However, I would like for my page to have more direction. I want my page to flow together and have a greater purpose than to just get to know me. I am in the process of applying for jobs but I am not sure how I can appeal to the consulting/business world. Although I like how easy going my page feels, I might need to go with a different feeling. Maybe more conservative or professional. I think this week will be focused on finding a purpose and creating a porfolio that exemplifies that purpose. Also, if I go the more professional route, I need to find pieces of my old projects to put in the porfolio."
"This weekend was devoted to creating my first portfolio. I actually found the whole experience to be quite fun as I got to put myself on a pedestal. Who doesn't like that? There were some challenges I found during this process. One of the first issues was figuring out what I wanted to make my portfolio about. Most people in the Aviation industry do not have such a thing like someone in the creative industry might have. This is simply because pilots are not very creative and see the world in 1s and 0s instead of colors. Kidding. But creating the portfolio challenged my creative side that is roughly non-existent. I truly tried to keep things interesting but I fear that maybe every page is the same. Oh well, at least it's consistent and should improve as the class progress. The next issue I had was figuring out what information to put in without 1. Boring everyone and 2. without confusing the heck out of people who have no aviation experience. I tried to be as inviting as warm as I can. From my experience, most people that want to start flying are quite shy as they do not ant to ""sound dumb"" and often just say they understand when really they don't. Hopefully the simplicity of this portfolio will guide those people and make them feel comfortable. Overall using weebly was a great experience. It took me a few hours to make, but I have to say, it was a relatively pain free assignment that was truly entertaining. This being a graded assignment as well as a tool to further my career is a really great thing. I will (hopefully) get a good grade as well as bring people into the wonderful world of aviation."
